The benefits of this improvement include:

Smaller Image Size: By using a multi-stage build, we reduce the size of the final image, leading to faster deployment times and optimization of resources.

Increased Security: Adding the ca-certificates package ensures that the application will have the necessary root certificates to establish secure connections, enhancing overall security.

Stability: Specifying a precise version of Alpine provides increased stability and predictability for the environment in which the application will run.

By addressing these aspects, the improved Dockerfile enhances performance, security, and stability of the containerized application.
